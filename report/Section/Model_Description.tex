\section{Model description}
In formulation of mathametical model has been made some assumption:

\begin{itemize}
    \item population have been categorized in three classes: \textit{susceptible} $S(t)$,\textit{infected} $I(t)$ and \textit{removed} $R(t)$;
    
    \item each class has been reported in percentage, dividing class for number of people;
    
    \item have been included birth rate and death rate not caused by disease (this element plays a key role in creation of not endemic equilibrium point that, without this paramter it would be an equilibrium set);
    
    \item no one child cannot get immunity by mother, so at birth child are included in \textit{susceptible};
    
    \item total population is constant during evolution of epidemy (to model this property birth rate and death rate have same value $mu > 0$);
    
    \item \textit{susceptible} class can be lost only being infected (this proprety has been modelled as $\beta S(t)I(t)$);
    
    \item infection rate has been modelled with paramter $\beta > 0$;
    
    \item characterstics as age, sex, social status don't change probability of be infected;
    
    \item disease is not a mortal one, so the only chance to lose class \textit{infected} is be healed by National Health System (this proprety has been modelled with $\gamma I(t)$).
    
\end{itemize}

Wit this assumption model became:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sir_model}
    \begin{array}{ccc}
         \dot{S} &=&\mu - \beta SI - \mu S\\
         \dot{I} &=&\beta SI - (\gamma + \mu)I\\
         \dot{R} &=&\gamma I - \mu R
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

Where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is the percentage of \textit{susceptible}: this variable can assume value $0 \leq S \leq 1$;
    \item $I$ is the percentage of \textit{infected}: this variable can assume value $0 \leq I \leq 1$;
    \item $R$ is the parcentage of \textit{removed}: this variable can assume value $0 \leq R \leq 1$;
    \item $\mu$ is the birth and death rate: this paramter can assume value $0 < \mu \leq 1$;
    \item $\beta$ is the probability that a susceptible person could be infected by an infected one: this paramter can assume value $0 < \beta \leq 1$;
    \item $\gamma$ is the rate of recovery of an infected person: this parameter can assume value $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$;
\end{itemize}

Moreover, it is necessary introduce $R_0$, a parameter that is usefull to discern different scenarios that will be analyzed in next sections:
\begin{quote}
    In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, denoted $R_0$, of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. \cite{bib:r0_definition}
\end{quote}

For SIR model considered in this project, $R_0$ can be defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:r0_definition}
    R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma + \mu}
\end{equation}

Given that by assumtion number of people is constant

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:population_constraint}
    S + I + R = 1
\end{equation}

It is possible to redifine \textit{removed} as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:removed_constrain}
    R = 1 - S - I
\end{equation}

Substituiting Equation (\ref{eq:removed_constrain}) in Equation (\ref{eq:sir_model}), it happens that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sir_model_2}
    \begin{array}{ccc}
         \dot{x_s} &=&\mu - \beta x_sx_i - \mu x_s\\
         \dot{x_i} &=&\beta x_sx_i - (\gamma + \mu)x_i\\
         \dot{x_r} &=&(\gamma + \mu) x_i + \mu x_s
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

It is possible to see that System (\ref{eq:sir_model_2}) is function only of variables $x_s$ e $x_i$, then can be consider subsystem

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sir_model_3}
    \begin{array}{ccc}
         \dot{x_s} &=&\mu - \beta x_sx_i - \mu x_s\\
         \dot{x_i} &=&\beta x_sx_i - (\gamma + \mu)x_i\\
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

In the end, given that

\begin{equation}
    0 \leq x_s \leq 1, 0 \leq x_i \leq 1, x_s + x_i \leq 1
\end{equation}

It is possible restict analysis of system at domain

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:roi}
    \Omega = \{ (x_s,x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_s \geq 0, x_i \geq 0, x_s + x_i \leq 1 \}
\end{equation}
