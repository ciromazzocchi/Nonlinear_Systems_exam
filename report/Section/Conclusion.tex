\section{Conclusion}
As has been shown in section 3, increasing health over an certain makes not endemic equilibrium asymptotically stable. But increasing this rate needs large amount of investiment in healt care and a lot of time. A future implementation of this report can be analyze evolution of epidemic in precence of saturation health care system.

During an epidemic, national lockdown can be a usefull way to keep infected under a predeterminated value. In ths report has been supposed that lockdown works immediately after emanation, a future implementation can be analyze evolution of epidemic with a $\beta$ that changes with a delay.

Another possible implementation can be take into account a vaccination campaign: stability has been proven in \cite{bib:sir_stability}, but could be added an analysis of bifurcations of codimension 2.

In the end, an alterntive way to analyze this type of system is to use social network, analyzing evolution of the network supposing hat a governament apply a tracking of people's health.
