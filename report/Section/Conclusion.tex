\section{Conclusion}
As has been shown in section 3, increasing health over an certain makes not endemic equilibrium asymptotically stable. But increasing this rate needs large amount of investiment in healt care and a lot of time. A future implementation of this report can be analyze evolution of epidemic in precence of sturation health care system.

During an epidemic, national lockdown can be a usefull way to keep infected under a predeterminated value. In ths report has been supposed that lockdown works immediately after emanation, a future implementation can be analyze evolution of epidemic with a $\beta$ that changes with a delay.

In the end, an alterntive way to analyze this type of system is to use social network, as has been made in \cite{bib:social_network_di_bernardo}.
