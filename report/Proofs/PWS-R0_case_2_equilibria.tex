\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $ 1+\delta\frac{\beta}{\mu} > R_0 > 1$. System (\ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}) has a not endemic equilibrium point $x_{ne}^*=(1,0)$ (saddle point) and an endemic equilibrium point $x_{e}^*=\left(\frac{1}{R_0}, \frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0 - 1\right)\right)$ (locally asymptotically stable).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{th:equilibria_lockdown} shows that $f^+$ has no one admissible equilibrium point for system \ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}.

For vector field $f^-$, Theorem \ref{th:sir_equilibria} shows that system has following equilibrium point

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    x_{ne} &=& (1,0) \\
    x_{e} &=& \left(\frac{1}{R_0}, \frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0 - 1\right)\right)
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

Givan that for $f^-$ condition $H(x) < 0$ must be fulfilled, this implies $x_i < \delta$. But for not endemic equilibrium point $x_{ne}$ happnes that

\begin{equation}
    \delta > 0 = x_i
\end{equation}

So $x_{ne}$ is a equilibrium point for the System (\ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}) that, as has been shown in Theorem \ref{th:R0_major_then_1_Equilibria}, is a saddle point.

For the endemic equilibrium point is mandatory fulfill condition

\begin{equation}
    H(x) < 0 \implies \delta > x_i = \frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0 - 1\right) \implies 1 < R_0 < 1 + \frac{\delta\beta}{\mu}
\end{equation}

So, endemic equilibrium point is admissible only if $1 < R_0 < 1 + \frac{\delta\beta}{\mu}$. Moreover, as has been shown in Theorem \ref{th:R0_major_then_1_Equilibria}, endemic equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable.
