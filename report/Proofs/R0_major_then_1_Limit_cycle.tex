For $R_0 > 1$ is not possible use the Bendixson - Dulac criterion because in $\Omega$ there is an equilibrium point that is locally asymptotically stable, ed removing this point from domain, $\Omega$ became a not simply connected domain.

It could apply PoincarÃ© - Bendixson Theorem to search periodic solution, but in section dedicated to stability analysis will be show that for $R_0 > 1$ endemic equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable in $\Omega_c \subset \Omega$, where $\Omega_c = \{\left(x_s,x_i\right) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_s > 0, x_i > 0, x_s + x_i < 1\}$, so there cannot be periodic solution in $\Omega$. This result is showed in Figure \ref{fig:phase_plane_r0_major_1}.
