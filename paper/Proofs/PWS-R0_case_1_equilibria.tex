\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $R_0 < 1$. Given the system \ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}, only ammissible equilibrium point is the not endemic equilibrium point $x_{ne}^*=(1,0)$ (node).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Lemma \ref{th:equilibria_lockdown} shows that $f^+$ has no one ammissible equilibrium point for the system \ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}.

For the vector field $f^-$, Theorem \ref{th:sir_equilibria} shows that system has one equilibrium point

\begin{equation}
    x_{ne} = (1,0)
\end{equation}

Since for $f^-$ is mandatory fulfill condition $H(x) < 0$, this implies that $x_i < \delta$. But for not endemic equilibrium $x_{ne}$ happens that

\begin{equation}
    \delta > 0 = x_i
\end{equation}

So $x_{ne}$ is an admissible equilibrium point for the system \ref{eq:sir_model_pws_1}.

Moreover, as has been shown in Theorem \ref{th:R0_minor_then_1_Equilibria}, not endemic equilibrium point has real negative eingevalues, so it is locally asymptotically stable (node).
\end{proof}
