\begin{theorem}
Suppose that $R_0 < 1$. So in $\Omega$ don't exist isolated periodic solution.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Is obvious verify that $\Omega$ is a simply connected domain.

Moreover, from equation \ref{eq:divergence} is possible verify that divergence of vector field \ref{eq:sir_model_3} is equal to zero in 

\begin{equation}
    (x_s - x_i) - \left(\frac{\mu}{\beta} + \frac{1}{R_0}\right) = 0 \implies (x_s - x_i) = \left(\frac{\mu}{\beta} + \frac{1}{R_0}\right) 
\end{equation}

But, by assumption

\begin{equation}
    R_0 < 1 \implies (x_s - x_i) = \left(\frac{\mu}{\beta} + \frac{1}{R_0}\right) > 1 \implies x_s > x_i + 1 \geq 1
\end{equation}

For each point $\left(x_s,x_i\right) \in \Omega$ is mandatory fulfill 

\begin{equation}
    x_s \leq 1
\end{equation}

So equation \ref{eq:divergence} cannot be equal to zero (and, consequently change sign) in a simply connected domain. For Bendixson-Dulac criterion \cite[pp.~67]{bib:khalil} don't exist isolated periodic solution in $\Omega$ .
\end{proof}
